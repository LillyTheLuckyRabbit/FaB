Milestones / Rubric

All milestones are not "in-lab" since we were finishing Project 4 during lab.

2 points - Lazy Foo Tutorial (Lessons 1 through 10)

2 points - Lazy Foo Tutorial (Lessons 11 through 20)

3 points - Lazy Foo Tutorial (Lessons 21 through 31)

3 points - Lazy Foo Tutorial (Lessons 32 through 45)

NOTE: For the Lazy Foo tutorials, I am skipping lesson 16, 22 through 25, 34, and 44. The reason
for skipping 16 is because for the final project, I am going to be using a sprite sheet instead
of TTF fonts. The reason I am skipping 22 through 25 and 44 is because I already familiarized
myself with SDL's "SDL_GetTicks" function and implemented delta frames in my compilable task.
I'm skipping 34 because I don't have a microphone to test it.
