Milestones / Rubric

All milestones are not "in-lab" since we were finishing Project 4 during lab.

10 points - Lazyfoo Tutorial (Lessons 1 through 45)

3 points - Design document detailing the gameplay of the game and establishing scope

1 point - Get 4 Xinput controllers detected and working

2 points - Get a player character on screen that can move and has physics

5 points - Implement basic splitscreen multiplayer using SDL viewports

8 points - Implement terrain, collision, and terrain generation

5 points - Implement weapons. CONTEXT: the points assigned to this is for the work that will go into the
initial implementation (a projectile system, particles for explosions, etc.). However, we will
continue to add weapons until the deadline if we have time for the sake of gameplay.

6 points - Implement "Ninja Rope." CONTEXT: the original Liero has a grappling hook type item that
we definitely want to add to our game. That being said, I'm assigning this task 6 points because
implementing elastic physics and having it tether to things correctly seems like it would be
difficult.
