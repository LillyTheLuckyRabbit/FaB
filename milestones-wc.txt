William Coar
Milestones / Rubric

All milestones are not "in-lab" since we were finishing Project 4 during lab.

2 points - Lazyfoo Tutorial (Lessons 1 through 10)

2 points - Lazyfoo Tutorial (Lessons 11 through 20)

3 points - Lazyfoo Tutorial (Lessons 21 through 31)

3 points - Lazyfoo Tutorial (Lessons 32 through 45)

3 points - Design document detailing the gameplay of the game and establishing scope

1 point - Get 4 Xinput controllers detected and working

2 points - Get a player character on screen that can move and has physics

5 points - Implement basic splitscreen multiplayer using SDL viewports

8 points - Implement terrain, collision, and terrain generation

5 points - Implement weapons. CONTEXT: the points assigned to this is for the work that will go
into the initial implementation (a projectile system, particles for explosions, etc.). However,
we will continue to add weapons until the deadline if we have time for the sake of gameplay.

6 points - Implement "Ninja Rope." CONTEXT: the original Liero has a grappling hook type item
that we definitely want to add to our game. That being said, I'm assigning this task 6 points
because implementing elastic physics and having it tether to things correctly seems like it
would be difficult.
