Time log for final project
David Butler

On 3/2 (lab), Will and I spent (unsure about the exact time) doing the following:
	-Creating project proposal
	-Brainstorming potential uses for data structures
	-Brainstorming other mechanics such as a weapons system

On 3/12, I spent 2 hours doing the following:
	-Installing SDL onto Ubuntu (on Windows 10)
	-Completing the first LazyFoo tutorial
		-Not being able to compile the tutorial due to an error where the library sdL2 wasn't being found
		-Scouring the internet to figure out why the library wasn't being found after installing
		-Realizing that it wasn't found as I did "-lsdL2" and not "-lSDL2"
		-Finally, I get to do the actual tutorial
		-Actually completing the first tutorial
	-Completing the second tutorial
		-Aside from figuring out where the .bmp file needed to be for it to load, I completed the second tutorial without a hitch.
	-Not exactly a graceful start, but now I won't need to go through the pain of getting a bunch of SDL stuff installed... Er, for now, anyways.

On 3/14, I spent 2 hours and 30 minutes doing the following:
	-Updating timelog, milestones, and prepwork
	-Completing writeup for Challenge7
	-Attempting to fix a weird issue
		-"error: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set in the environment.
		SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error: No available video device"
		-Occurs whenever I attempt to run any of the SDL tutorials
		-Did not happen yesterday... Weird.
	-Created some mock-up sprites for the characters
	-Created a mock-up to determine if the sprites would be big enough for the current screen resolution and 4 player split-screen.
		-Mock-up images can be found in the folder, "db-mockups" (found under the "prep_butler" folder).

On 3/22-3/23, I spent 1 hour and 45 minutes doing the following:
	-Reinstalling SDL via minGW on the windows 10 command prompt (SDL on Ubuntu failed to work)
		-Tutorial used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybYMOKEW9IY
		-I had some issues with #include <SDL2/SDL.h> not working and make not being found
			-I eventually solved it by downloading more packages on the MinGW installer
		-I got the first LazyFoo tutorial to successfully compile and run (again)!
	-Updated time log
	
From 3/25-3/27, I spent 4 hours and 45 minutes doing the following
	-Completed LazyFoo SDL tutorials 1-41 (Fortunately it's much faster now that I have MinGW working)
		-Skipped tutorials 10, 20, 24, 25, 34, 36, 37, and 42, as they were irrelevant to our final project
	-Updated time log
