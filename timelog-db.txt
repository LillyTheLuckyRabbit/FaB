Time log for final project
David Butler

On 3/2 (lab), Will and I spent (unsure about the exact time) doing the following:
	-Creating project proposal
	-Brainstorming potential uses for data structures
	-Brainstorming other mechanics such as a weapons system

On 3/12, I spent 2 hours doing the following:
	-Installing SDL onto Ubuntu (on Windows 10)
	-Completing the first LazyFoo tutorial
		-Not being able to compile the tutorial due to an error where the library sdL2 wasn't being found
		-Scouring the internet to figure out why the library wasn't being found after installing
		-Realizing that it wasn't found as I did "-lsdL2" and not "-lSDL2"
		-Finally, I get to do the actual tutorial
		-Actually completing the first tutorial
	-Completing the second tutorial
		-Aside from figuring out where the .bmp file needed to be for it to load, I completed the second tutorial without a hitch.
	-Not exactly a graceful start, but now I won't need to go through the pain of getting a bunch of SDL stuff installed... Er, for now, anyways.
