Time log for final project
David Butler

On 3/2 (lab), Will and I spent (unsure about the exact time) doing the following:
	-Creating project proposal
	-Brainstorming potential uses for data structures
	-Brainstorming other mechanics such as a weapons system

On 3/12, I spent 2 hours doing the following:
	-Installing SDL onto Ubuntu (on Windows 10)
	-Completing the first LazyFoo tutorial
		-Not being able to compile the tutorial due to an error where the library sdL2 wasn't being found
		-Scouring the internet to figure out why the library wasn't being found after installing
		-Realizing that it wasn't found as I did "-lsdL2" and not "-lSDL2"
		-Finally, I get to do the actual tutorial
		-Actually completing the first tutorial
	-Completing the second tutorial
		-Aside from figuring out where the .bmp file needed to be for it to load, I completed the second tutorial without a hitch.
	-Not exactly a graceful start, but now I won't need to go through the pain of getting a bunch of SDL stuff installed... Er, for now, anyways.

On 3/14, I spent 2 hours and 30 minutes doing the following:
	-Updating timelog, milestones, and prepwork
	-Completing writeup for Challenge7
	-Attempting to fix a weird issue
		-"error: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set in the environment.
		SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error: No available video device"
		-Occurs whenever I attempt to run any of the SDL tutorials
		-Did not happen yesterday... Weird.
	-Created some mock-up sprites for the characters
	-Created a mock-up to determine if the sprites would be big enough for the current screen resolution and 4 player split-screen.
		-Mock-up images can be found in the folder, "db-mockups" (found under the "prep_butler" folder).

On 3/22-3/23, I spent 1 hour and 45 minutes doing the following:
	-Reinstalling SDL via minGW on the windows 10 command prompt (SDL on Ubuntu failed to work)
		-Tutorial used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybYMOKEW9IY
		-I had some issues with #include <SDL2/SDL.h> not working and make not being found
			-I eventually solved it by downloading more packages on the MinGW installer
		-I got the first LazyFoo tutorial to successfully compile and run (again)!
	-Updated time log
	
From 3/25-3/27, I spent 4 hours and 45 minutes doing the following
	-Completed LazyFoo SDL tutorials 1-41 (Fortunately it's much faster now that I have MinGW working)
		-Skipped tutorials 10, 20, 24, 25, 34, 36, 37, and 42, as they were irrelevant to our final project
	-Updated time log

From 4/4-4/5, I spent ~2 hours and 30 minutes doing the following
	-Modifying Will's bouncing ball test
		-Adding particles whenever the ball hits the ground fast enough
			-My implementation compiled but was kinda sloppy, particles didn't work.
		-Fixing a physics calculation bug that occurs whenever the game screen is moved
			-Moving the screen causes the game to mess up the ball's Y velocity due to the game's timer being updated but everything else paused
			-I attempted to solve this by using window events to pause the game. No dice.
			-Instead, I found a solution from: https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/527683-sdl-dragging-window-problem/
				-Adding a max for the delta time fixes the bug, neat!
	
On 4/11, I spent 3ish hours doing the following
	-Getting the "first draft" of the final project to compile
		-I had to use "Get-Content input.txt | ./fab.exe > output.txt" in windows power shell in order to get it to run fine
	-Examining the code for rendering and creating a background texture
		-I attempted to use the rendering code for the players as a base
			-I couldn't get the background to render... Spoot.
			-There are still a few issues with rendering in any case. Ah well, progress is being made nonetheless!
	-Added code to prevent players from moving out of bounds of the level (to make troubleshooting the rendering easier)

On 4/12, I spent (unsure of the exact time, about 0.5-1 hours?) doing the following:
	-Creating sprites for FAB (Fun and Balanced)
		-Began making player sprites
			-Ended up messing up the dimensions, I'll have to come back to them later :/
		-Created a sprite for dirt terrain
			-I may still to tweak it to make it tile better, but this is fine for demo purposes.

On 4/18, I spent 1 hour doing the following:
	-Finished player sprites
	-Made sprites for guns/projectiles

On 4/19, I spent most of the day (~5 hours?) doing the following:
	-Troubleshooting the program's resolution with Will
		-Will and I use different systems, the Windows version's camera is too low
		-As a temporary solution, I shrunk the resolution size if the game is played on Windows.
			-Will ended up finding a better solution later
	-Making an algorithm for terrain generation
		-Uses disjoint sets to create tunnels and determine if all players are in the same tunnel (at which point the algorithm is done)
		-Created Terrain class
		-At this time the algorithm occasionally crashes by going out of scope

On 4/20, I spent less than an hour doing the following:
	-Creating powerpoint presentation for the BYODS day

On 4/21, I spent about 2 hours doing the following:
	-Fixed the bugs with terrain generation
		-Turns out the algorithm was sometimes going out of scope for the right/up bounds of the level
	-Finished presentation slides with Will

On 4/25, I spent a little bit doing the following:
	-Added more bullet sprites in preparation for tomorrow
	
On 4/26, I spent 4 hours doing the following:
	-It's my birthday today so that means this project gets a birthday wish bonus I'm pretty sure.
	-Remembered to use a timer so I could actually report an accurate number of hours for once instead of approximating
	-Adding/tweaking weapons
		-Changed code for weapon gravity and acceleration
			-May still be buggy
		-Added Six shooter, Flamethrower, Shotgun, and Laser weapons
		-Added weapon spread
			-There's an interesting bug with weapon spread that causes the squid character to spaz out with their gun
		-Added weapon auto fire
			-Players can just hold down the fire button instead of pressing it over and over
	-Modified a few other things
		-Fixed a bug where players would get stuck shooting after dying
		-Tweaked the dash reflect slightly
			-Dash reflect may need to be nerfed some more :/
	-Noted bugs:
		-There's still a bug where players don't have gravity for a bit after dying
		-Players can spam jump when against the level borders to go up
			-Likewise, players can sometimes glitch upwards through terrain by spamming jump
